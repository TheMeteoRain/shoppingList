Two ways to run application:
    java -jar shoppingList.jar cli
    java -jar shoppingList.jar gui

    
CLI-version has three simple functions:
    - Add item
    - Add items
    - Show items
    
GUI-version is more rich with functionalities. And there are two ways 
to use GUI-version. One is local-mode and other one is remote-mode.
With local-mode you can make text files from shopping lists.
Local-mode functions:
    - Add/edit/remove item
    - Save shopping list
    - Open shopping list
    - Combine shopping lists
Remote-mode allows users to make changes to database shopping list.
Remote-mode functions:
    - Add/edit/remove item
